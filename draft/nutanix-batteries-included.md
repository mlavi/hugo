title: "What is Nutanix? My Elevator Pitch"
---

The Nutanix Enterprise Cloud OS platform now consists of software on premises and as a service (SaaS) for solutions that bridge the traditional data center and progressive cloud ready worlds. This disruptive approach means that understanding Nutanix is an evolving process because the company is evolving from an appliance to software only to on-demand subscription services.

# Elevator Pitch #

I'm on the plane on my way back from my third Nutanix global Sales Kick Off (SKO) meeting in Las Vegas. I received and accepted my job offer during Nutanix SKO two years ago, while Calm.io was in the process of the Nutanix acquisition.

Prior to Nutanix, the majority of my career had been in engineering and IT, but at this point in my life, I can say I feel comfortable in the world of sales and solutions architecture. It is rewarding work with my colleagues to change our customers' "business as usual" to constantly improving their "business as unusual." We take customers out of their comfort zones and silos by exposing them to new cultures, skill sets, and methodologies which then allows them to understand our company, products, and services, how we accelerate business, and how we do it better than anyone else on the planet.

Two years ago, I went to new hire training the following month of SKO and one of the team exercises was to craft and deliver a Nutanix elevator pitch. *I'm going to try to find it because I can't remember it fully.*

It is hard to explain Nutanix in thirty seconds or less unless you know your audience and can gauge their technical acumen as well as their current understanding of Nutanix.

"Nutanix is a software company that has commercialized Google data center technology and even better, Nutanix has consumerized that technology to add an Apple like experience: Nutanix updates and accelerates businesses."

# Explaining Nutanix Architecture #

    "The future is already here â€” it's just not very evenly distributed."
    --[William Gibson](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/William_Gibson#Quotes)

When I have a technical audience, I lend more credence to this elevator pitch, which hints at Nutanix DNA and expansion to a platform.

"Nutanix's co-founder came from the Google filesystem team, we have commercialized Google cloud technology to pioneer the HCI market by delivering software defined storage, virtualization, and networking: this is the Acropolis data plane. Nutanix's control plane, called Prism, presents a single pane of glass experience to manage multiple clusters on-prem and multiple off-prem clouds with hybrid cloud applications. Nutanix's goal is to make Infrastructure and public clouds invisible, increasingly moving up the stack to multiple services and consumption models, driving application centric business results."

# Freedom and Batteries Included #

So the journey is to progress up the stack, consolidating commoditized tiers.
The foundation of the infrastructure stack is HCI: storage+virtualization+network.
The current stage is to extend stack to multiple clouds and add to the stack application lifecycle orchestration.
Applications complete the journey to the top of the stack, but now there is an increasing commoditization of
application infrastructure: push button databases on demand, basic monitoring and scaling operations, and so on.
