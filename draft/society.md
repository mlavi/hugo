When one adopts the lens of "Pets versus Cattle" as an effective manner to manage
 resources, it becomes easy to deconstruct the world to find inefficiency and
 injustice through societal power dynamics. How far can one go with this lens to
 understand what models work and what traditions can no longer be justified?

# Basic Power Models

Table: societal organization, ordered by size

| Family  | Blood: Clan/Tribe           | Town/Village  |
| Fiscal+blood | Living space: neighborhood  |
|         | Enclave/Compound            |
|  City>County>State>Nation>Planet>Solar System>Galaxy>Cosmos |

Of course, sports (as remnants of the city-state) overlays are fun organizing cultural factors
Political gerrymandering is certainly a corrupting influence.

# The Dictator as Pet

Through societal contract, often enforced by military might, a Dictator seeks to
exploit the entire aggregated power of citizens, by making them cattle and giving
the promise of equality, justice, or fiscal guarantee.

The problem is that the reverse does not apply: the Dictator is a pet without
replacement and a single point of failure, witness the late stage determination for rights of succession, potential
chaos during transition, and typical reversion to family/blood ties for control.
Dictators are anti-disaster recovery for their role, they want their failure to be
a disaster for society, because ultimately, society's well being are not the priority,
preservation and expansion of their power overrides all concerns.

Thank goodness the American Constitution provides for rights of succession and
impeachment of the President's role: the President is a role which can be "cattled" to the next so society can proceed without.
It is a not a "COUP" as Mr. Trump manipulates his followers to believe unless he
willfully ignores the Constitution, which he swore to uphold during inauguration.
Our President displays alarming traits which shows his character is beneath
previous successful holders of the Office.

# Socialism is American Tool, Not a Slur

Our government has created safety nets for our society.
We should be judged by how well we treat, not deny, the lowest ranks of our society.
The ideas of supporting #woundedwarrior should extend to all war veterans and
reform of the VA where possible.

Putting your money where your mouth is: would you support legislation that
allows each individual citizen to "opt-out" of Social Security as a one-time,
permanently binding, public declaration? Previously contributed funds would be
forfeit and redistributed to the Social Security pool.

If such legislation passes, would you invoke it to opt out of a socialist construct?
Or have you been conditioned by a label in the context of emotional manipulation?
Problems with social security probably exist and should remedied via reform.

# The Friendly NSA = @FriendlyNSA

Since government surveillance is a known problem our society has yet to reconcile
any oversight and abuse with our freedoms and privacy, perhaps a humorous parody
might help. It should illustrate the absurdity and hypocrisy the American government
continues to pervade.

- Hey @FriendlyNSA, can you restore that file I accidentally deleted?
  - Sure, here's yesterdays version.
    - Would you like something earlier or a more recent version from draft/buffers?
  - Sorry, you're not a tax paying citizen, I cannot offer you this
    "backup and restoral" service without a fee and public disclosure of the contents.
- Hey @FriendlyNSA, can you settle a bet for me: did I say that X would Y?
  - No, you did not say those exact words to randomZ, but our semantic algorithm indicates
    you could have meant them.
    - Pro-tips for next time to provide a better @friendlyNSA service:
      1. Speak precisely and closer to the mic.
      2. Avoid ambiguous statements in language L.
      3. Stand closer to the window for visual parsing.
      4. Undrape and open windows when possible.
  - Yes, you totally said X would Y in language L.
    1. But it was under duress, according to our aural lie detector algorithm.
