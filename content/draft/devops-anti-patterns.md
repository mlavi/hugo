DevOps is a cultural term, so in a recent discussion with my friend, David Hawthorne,
we spoke about what "DevOps is not..." and I think it could be a hilarious article.

In response to my DevOps maturity model, David pointed out the
[Capability_Maturity_Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model)
followed by the parody of the
[Capability_Immaturity_Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Immaturity_Model)
and we thought it would be easy to come up with some examples.

So let's negatively assert DevOps!

# DevOps is not:

## A Certificate
Let's look on the web for corruption... :)

## A Job Title
## A Team
## Something you can buy

## Achievable
... meaning it is never finished, we constantly can improve our state of the art and learn from our community as new idea, methods, frameworks, software, and more develop!
Hence I call DevOps a process, much like security. Let's work to improve our craftsmanship of our practices.
