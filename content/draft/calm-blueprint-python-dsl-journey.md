title: "The Calm Blueprint Python DSL Journey"
---
Calm blueprints are business artifacts incorporating infrastructure, operations, and governance as code, enabling any business initiative with 1-click self-service and continuous operations. The Calm blueprint life cycle belongs in the domain of software engineering with collaborative revision control, CI/CD, and GitOps. This has been greatly aided by the new Calm blueprint Python DSL: Domain Specific Language!

# Why Calm Blueprints?

# Why Calm Blueprint Python DSL?

In short: programming languages, combined with data formats, bridges to the entire world of software engineering benefits and provides a next generation experience.

I will overgeneralize the previous generations of automation evolution to this progression of successive and overlapping areas:

- Command line interface (CLI) shell scripting
  - Typically sequential and hard coded
- Client-Server operating system automation
  - Typically command and control of shell scripting
- Configuration Management
  - Next generation shell scripting, abstracting OS, etc. e.g.:
    - Puppet: DSL
    - Chef: Ruby DSL
    - Salt: YaML/TOML
    - RedHat Ansible: YaML
- Infrastructure as Code
  - HashiCorp Terraform: HCL (~YAML)
  - (just for fun) Kubernetes: YAML
