# BOOK CHAPTER: DRAFT PROPOSAL
nicolas.sauvage@tdk-ventures.com
Andreas Constantinou <andreas@slashdata.co>

Andreas, thank you again, you are your team organized and ran an amazingly valuable event!

I wanted to add some additional feedback on the event:
1.	I purposefully did not respond to you pre-event survey, primarily because Luke would represent our DevRel program.
2.	Somehow I missed that Diversity was a key theme of the conference, that ignorance is reflected in my written feedback response collected at the end of the event.

An update since the event: @Luke Kilpatrick introduced me to Nicolas Sauvage during his visit to our offices on Thursday (TDK and Nutanix share some office buildings). We discussed the idea for a chapter for the third edition of the DevRel Handbook!

For Nutanix, our Developer Relations program has been rescoped after the inaugural year to “DevOps Marketing” and represents a skunkworks team led by Luke with top level visibility as one of our Marketing organization’s execution initiatives. Therefore, we primarily target a different persona who represents the Nutanix customer base	, which may represent a blind spot for the entire DevRel industry, because I heard definite interest from Amanda Whaley@Cisco when I spoke with her on this topic. I recall from your developer survey research slides, the indisputable breakout topic that developers wanted to learn more about was: DevOps.

While DevOps is an ambiguous term in many ways, a simple interpretation is that it represents the hybridization of the Developer and Operations audience and roles. This reveals and implies the missing persona: the Operator. He said it seems “orthogonal” to the current handbook personas. There are three parallel, but related, and arguably convergent paths happening for the evolution of three personas, the industry, and their career responsibilities:

1.	Developers and their teams who must now support their code in production.
•	E.g.: the Netflix mantra is something like: "You build it, you run it.”
•	This appears to be a new hiring qualification and component of job descriptions for developers, past the full stack
•	As PaaS and serverless continue to democratize operations, developers cannot be divorced from production
“It runs on my laptop” also means it runs in production
•	Feature flags, which allow conditional release of work in production
•	The rise of GitOps!
2.	DevOps practitioners and teams, which already bridge development and operations.
•	These unicorns must stay on top of both personas in addition to their own evolving field of infrastructure as code, cloud native services, and more
•	Long-term, DevOps should disappear as the two other personas evolve to encompass more and more overlap with each other
•	Alternatively, DevOps could be seen as consuming both of the other personas
3.	Operators and operations teams, who must increase automation practices to scale to business needs.
•	Operator as consumer of automaton for infrastructure
•	Operator as developer of automation across infrastructure disciplines of storage, network, compute+virtualization, security and their higher constructs
•	Operator as developer of application lifecycle management for business and continuous operations.

I learned from Nicholas that a successful chapter contribution should be about 5K words, +/- 10%, due in June. It should distill learning/best practices as well as failure experiences/mistakes. By telling a story of a journey, it can establish creditability. Next, it should conclude with the current state of the art for thought leadership. Finally, explain next steps for real or hypothetical work.

He mentioned “dev grants” which confused me, but perhaps he meant dev guides; i.e.: if there are essential “talking to developers” guides, perhaps we could create the analog for “talking to operators.”

Anyhow, I wanted to write down my meeting notes, expanded justification, and share with you, Nicholas, and Luke!
