title: "Shellmaster: Mastering the Command Line Interface"
---
Through my years of DOS, Unix, and Linux, I've scraped by just fine with the command line and shell scripting. But over the past two years, I've worked to improve my mastery because there's no other place to bootstrap automation. So I'm documenting some of my learnings and research goals.

Even when I worked at SGI and started to work with the the DCO: Data Center Operations teams, I thought I'd find the gods of the command line for system administation, and I did to some extent, but it was rare for me to pick up a trick. I did find one SysAdmin (Brent) who did software development, and he did expose me to parallel makes and other ideas for automation.

A software developer, ChrisX@Kaazing, also exposed me to more powerful CLI usage, using ^R to find matching history.

My VP of Engineering, Ronn@Pertino, extolled the ability to use ^Y and ^W when quipping with other engineers.

There were so many hidden tricks, potentially going back to 1970's epoch birth of Unix, but why didn't I know any of them?

## man Up

Well, reading the man pages for bash was one important key step forward, but I needed
a plane ride disconnected from the Internet to finally do it!

Even this week, I learned more about man

## First was the command line, by Neal Stephenson

Still haven't finished this.
