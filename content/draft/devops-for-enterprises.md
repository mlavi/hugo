As the pace of digital transformation (DX) increases, enterprises are moving from
on-premises data center to public and private clouds on the road to hybrid cloud.
The progression from "cloud first" to "cloud smart" is merely another vestige of
the DevOps journey.

My new colleague, [Patrick Campbell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickntnx)

joined Nutanix's competitive analysis team from an automation competitor and we
teamed up to write a guest blog at the invitation of [Inedo](https://inedo.com/),
a firm specializing in Windows based software delivery release and management!

Our blog [DevOps for Enterprises](https://blog.inedo.com/devops-for-enterprises)
captures a discussion Patrick and I had about the relentless pursuit of the state of the art
for DevOps and automation, a universal passion we share with Inedo!

The public cloud democratized infrastructure, creating an on-demand experience,
and this has led to an easy entry point for every business and software team to embrace
continuous integration, delivery, and deployment (CI/CD). However, the initial
exuberance of unlimited, on-demand infrastructure for self-service workloads
quickly leads to over-provisioning, waste, and cloud re-repatriation.

I like to call this the trap of lift and shift.
