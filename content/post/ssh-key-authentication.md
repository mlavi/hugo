For those of you new to automation, Linux, and SSH keypairs:
 Calm Marketplace blueprints leverage all of these with cloud-init to
 enable security best-practices, but it can be overwhelming on first
 exposure to handle every link in the chain to launch your first blueprint.

# Under Construction #
I will continue to update and expand this blog, it serves as a script for
 a quick video I plan to make.

# The Basics #

- Linux operating system images ready for the cloud do not have any
  accounts with credentials by default.
  - Therefore, one cannot remotely log in to a cloud VM = security best practice.
- Static passwords are pets, passwords should have a dynamic lifecycle.
  - But if you must use a static password, make it mathematically secure.
  - SSH keys = long mathematical passwords, broken into public and private parts.

Combining these two ideas together, one would want to dynamically insert
 SSH public keys onto a cloud VM during instantiation.
 For Linux, cloud-init provides this facility.

## The Details ##

[Secure SHell (SSH)](https://www.openssh.com/) keys can be generated by:

- [ssh-keygen](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1) in Linux and MacOS
- [cygwin](http://cygwin.org/) on Windows to get the OpenSSH suite
  - Perhaps? it is easier to use [Windows Powershell SSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/core-powershell/ssh-remoting-in-powershell-core?view=powershell-6), but I haven't tried this yet.
- [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)-gen on Windows
  - For exported PuTTY keys, they have their own .PPK format.
  - Insure you export the public key, then private key in OpenSSH format
  and append .pem file suffix.
- Make your keys passphraseless (*i.e.* no password to unlock)
 and store them in a secure place.

# Use Your SSH Keypair #

How do I put the SSH public key onto a VM image?

## Easy Way ##
  - bake credentials into the VM image by putting SSH cred on an VM,
  - export a snapshot of the VM,
  - use that as your image with the pre-seeded SSH credential.

We use the easy way at Calm bootcamps, but it is a bad security practice
 for credentials to be static. Start here, but improve to the next section
 after you've achieved your first success. To use static credential in the Calm blueprint:

- For each service, select that VM image with SSH credentials
- In the Application Profile, populate the public key variable with your public key
  and uncheck the runtime checkbox.
- In the Credentials section, upload your private key, toggle off runtime icon.
- Launch your blueprint and insure Calm can login and orchestrate your VM images.
  - Troubleshooting: insure that cloud-init username matches the Credentials
  login account name.

## Security Best Practice ##
- For Linux, use a cloud-init enabled VM image
- Use cloud-init to inject your public key upon VM boot
(you can do this for AHV VMs with the guest-customization area in Calm)
 as a runtime variable in the Application profile
- Give Calm your private key as a runtime credential during launch
- This is the practice we use for the Marketplace blueprints on Linux.
