### Ship the Bits

It used to be that software release management was as simple as performing a desktop build and 
then uploading the results to a FTP server and notifying the world by updating the web site for
your product.

Software repositories can be that simple, but the state of the art has advanced! There are many
considerations for release management today:

But what about installers? licenses? compression into a one file archive? checksums and key signing?
mirrors and content delivery networks? metadata for packaging? download counts and bandwidth constaints?
priviledged downloads? internal release candidates for testing versus official released builds?

build numbers and version numbers and release numbers? are they the same thing?
