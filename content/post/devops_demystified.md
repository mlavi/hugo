For a term that is not even six years old, DevOps remains a mysterious pursuit
 for many software engineering organizations. Let me define DevOps to help you
 understand and chart your own journey to DevOps. *Hint:* it is a cultural term!

### Update: 2015-10-16

I have polished the slides to reinforce and elaborate on key points.
I am happy to give this talk to any organization
 and I have provided the slides for you to present as well!
Please contact me with any follow up questions or comments.

### Abstract

A brief history of the DevOps movement and community with a cross section view of many methods
and practices that are breaking down the barriers to achieve agility and continuous delivery.
DevOps seems intangible: you can't buy it, there is no certification, and frankly, there is no
universal definition, yet everyone wants it or already "does" it, but still has trouble
identifying it.
I will cover many topics so that you can understand and chart your own journey to DevOps.

### Agenda

 - A Definition and Cultural Rendering of DevOps
 - A Brief History of DevOps
 - DevOps Impact on Organizations
 - The Journey to DevOps:
     - Cloud Agility
     - Infrastructure as Code
     - Test, Build, Deploy Pattern
     - Pets versus Cattle versus Bacteria
     - Infrastructure Models and Orchestration
 - Epilogue: BusinessOps

### DevOps Definition

DevOps is the *process* of removing all friction between the developer and customer value.

However, DevOps is a culturally rendered term: it is practiced by people and dynamically bound
to their capabilities.
