For a term that is not even six years old, DevOps remains a mysterious pursuit
 for many software engineering organizations. Let me define DevOps and help
 you can understand and chart your own journey to DevOps. Hint: it is a cultural term!

### Update: 2015-10-16

I have polished the slides to reinforce and elaborate on key points.
Please contact me with any follow up questions or comments.
I am happy to give this talk to any organization and I have provided the slides for you to present as well!

### Abstract

A brief history of the DevOps movement and community with a cross section view of many methods and practices that are breaking down the barriers to achieve agility and continuous delivery.
DevOps seems intangible: you can't buy it, there is no certification, and frankly, there is no universal definition, yet everyone wants it or already "does" it, but still has trouble identifying it.
I will cover many topics so that you can understand and chart your own journey to DevOps.

The actual content of this blog post has been given as a talk:
