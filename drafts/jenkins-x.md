Back from JenkinsWorld 2019 in San Francisco and I'm ready to shed most of my
"classic legacy" experience for the newer Jenkins-X cloud-native, GitOps driven
experience. Let's bootstrap a [cd.foundation](https://cd.foundation/) CI/CD project!
<!--more-->

Here's the overview:

- Hardware: Linux Mint 19.1 (@my desktop: 12GB RAM, AMD Phenom II X4 955 Processor)
- Installation:
  - docker?
  - manual: VirtualBox 6.10 + extension pack
  - binary (copied to ~/bin/):
    - jx
    - helm
    - minikube
  - Homebrew (for Linux):
    - kubectl
  - Github Personal Access Token (and a separate organization for my lab work)
