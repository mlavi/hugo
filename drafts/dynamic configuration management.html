    <title>dynamic configuration management</title>

  <body>
    As infrastructure migrates from static and long lived to virtual and
    ephemeral, supporting architectures like DNS, load balancers,
    firewalls, and networks must adapt to continual change, creating a
    management burden for systems that aren't automated or do not scale.
    A DevOps mindset will help guide your evaluation of new and old
    solutions that help with resource inventory, service discovery, and
    dynamic configuration management.<br>
    <br>
    How does one manage an inventory? With a spreadsheet that requires
    manual updates every time a change occurs. One can evolve to an
    accounting system of assets or realize that an inventory is part of
    a larger supply chain of vendors, partners, and customers and adopt
    an enterprise management system which integrates these concerns and
    hopefully integrates with other systems to automate the inventory
    process. As we adopt multiple data centers and clouds for global
    capacity and redundancy, we see a similar evolution in DevOps
    tooling where we can integrate different providers and populations
    of resources.<br>
    <br>
    Configuration management represents an ideal way to automate the
    building of infrastructure and can maintain a resource inventory for
    nodes under its control.<br>
    <br>
    There is more than one way to do things: there are trade offs to
    where you shift the functionality when you remove configuration
    management. The good news is that the Calm blueprint can easily
    serve as a proxy for lightweight requirements of application state
    maintenance and here docs in shell is the easiest manner to drive
    that to configuration files.<br>
    <br>
    You could consider any number of Ruby template libraries, like ERB,
    since that seems to be a language you are familiar with. Despite
    performance concerns, I also think Consul templates might be
    considerable.<br>
    As you refactor towards containers, you will see that static
    configuration files are friction on making containers dynamic.
    Therefore, dynamic configuration management (essentially lookups)
    for application configuration are desirable and many people use
    environment variables as their first approach with containers. I'm
    going to blog on this topic.<br>
    <br>
    If you can bootstrap a container (with environment variables) to
    query a data source (a database, registry, LDAP, DNS, Consul,
    Zookeeper, etcd, etc.) you can make a container much more dynamic
    and reusable.<br>
    Let me give you two references that point the way to microservices
    from our webinar:
    https://calm.io/wp-content/uploads/2016/webinar/deploying_docker_containers_in_production/#/section-2/page-4
    -- see the "Twelve-Factor App" for principles and "12 Fractured
    Apps" counter-examples<br>
    <br>
    Finally, we have a whole new category of lookups/dynamic
    configuration management that has implications on the application
    code base, but really is the logical conclusion of this journey:
    feature flags, which goes by a number of other names like "lighting"
    features. Essentially, you can ship code execution paths that are
    toggled on and off by dynamic configuration management. In this
    manner, given proper instrumentation, you can canary test code in
    production, determine its "health," and revert even faster then
    redeployment.<br>
    As you can see, we're beginning to move away from static
    configuration files.
