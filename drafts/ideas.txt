# The Book of Calm #
    Work with Poitras?

Web scale infrastructure requires web scale application architecture and operations.
Operations at scale cannot be performed by hand: you have already lost the game if
you think you can solve a problem in production by looking or fixing one server.

One must re-imagine the business of IT to deliver a cloud experience and often,
this means shedding traditional approaches to achieve a "digital transformation."

Infrastructure + Apps + ops + culture must progress to hybridize and share responsibilities.
I happen to call this state the result of adopting DevOps and can elaborate...

Calm was born from bare metal data center orchestration workflow engine called Epsilon.
Epsilon is written in Python and has a microservice architecture so it could scale workers for parallel orchestrate execution on large data centers.
Workflows are python scripts.

Calm grew out of the need to address private and public cloud infrastructures, by adding a GUI to abstract
any type of infrastructure service to deliver applications. This top down model of
the application allows it to be driven onto multiple infrastructures.
