  - Case # is 04153538
  - Please choose one of the following options to RMA the unit:
Option 1:
Standard Warranty Replacement (SWR): this option requires sending the faulty product to our facilities under your expenses. Once the part is received, it might take from 3 to 5 business days for the screening process and paperwork, then it takes two more days for shipping. At the end it could be a 6 to 7 business day’s turnaround from the moment the bad unit is received.
Option 2:
Cross Shipping: This is a replacement method that allows you receiving the new product in advance including the packaging material and a pre-paid return label. The part usually is sent via “overnight shipping” and most likely you get it the next day after the order is placed. The service requires covering a $25 fee for shipping and handling not refundable and an extra charge equal to the price of the product in question. This extra charge is just for security and will be refunded back to you once the bad part is received.
Finally, bear in mind that this last option only applies if you are located within the United States or Canada; also please make sure that your shipping address is the same as your billing address.
Note: Using USPS could result in a 2-4 day delay in your product reaching the UPS depot.
Your waybill will identify when the product was delivered to the US Postal Service and not UPS. The UPS will not be visible to you.
  - I will be transferring your case to the warranty department and they will be get in contact with you tomorrow morning since we are already closing.
