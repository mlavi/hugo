Gaining public cloud experience is crucial to IT careers today because it represents virtualization's next generation experience. Immaturity themes for over-reliance on the public cloud are typically due to false hopes, Operational Expenditure (OpEx) accounting, and vendor lock-in. Public Cloud salvation is when one can drive to a new cloud maturity stage with operations and workloads to multiple clouds with blended resource management. I'll explore the causes and solutions to progress cloud maturity.

## The Case for the Public Cloud ##

I've talked to many customers over the past four years across the world in nearly every industry of nearly every size.

Many people in IT have built their career on virtualization, but in 2005 I was lucky enough to work at a high performance compute Unix/Linux hardware+software company (SGI), mostly skip on-prem virtualization, and jump exclusively into the public cloud for my next job at a Silicon Valley start-up in 2011.

The public cloud is alluring for many reasons:

- On-demand infrastructure
- Platform as a service offerings
- Developer self-service
- OpEx experience
- Outsourced support

I find that as much as customers extoll these public cloud benefits, their cloud maturity prevents business efficiency, leading to negative outcomes of false hopes, OpEx Accounting,  and lock-in. After explaining these pitfalls, I will show how cloud maturity leads to solutions which prevent or correct these business mistakes, and achieve public cloud salvation!

## Public Cloud Pitfalls ##
### False Hopes ###

I am astounded, even today, when IT organizations and their management, still polmulgate the public cloud as their business' salvation.

### Hypervisor Migration ###
### OpEx Accounting ###
### Vendor Lock-in ###
Proprietary APIs and Hotel California effect for workloads, due to network transit costs, every public cloud is a fiscal island.

## Cloud Maturity for Public Cloud Salvation ##

Because the public cloud is easy and quick to consume, it allows adoption to occur without proper consideration or responsibility. I observe the rush to public cloud and with enough time, the complaints of expense, and eventual retreat or resource rebalance.

The fundamental problem is that most adopters have no immediate fiscal responsibility. Even the most senior IT leadership of fiscal institutions plan to exploit and maximize their annual spend budgets over gaining efficiencies by subordinating their expenditures because of basic human nature: it will always be easier to spend than to save. Only maturity and responsibility change our viewpoint from short term expenditures to long-term, efficient resource management.

### Blended Resource Management ###
### Resource Lifecycle Management ###
